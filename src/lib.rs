# Image Converter (imgc)

Welcome to imgc!

This tool is a command-line utility built with Rust, focusing on converting images into the WebP format. Leveraging the powerful [image crate](https://github.com/image-rs/image), imgc simplifies the process of batch converting images, optimizing for both performance and storage efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Conversion**: Easily convert a variety of image formats to WebP with lossless compression.
- **Broad Format Support**: Works with many popular image formats, including PNG and JPEG.
- **Custom Output**: Choose where your converted images are saved.
- **Speedy Processing**: Takes advantage of `rayon` for fast, parallel processing.
- **Glob Pattern Support**: Since imgc is not yet available on crates.io, you'll need to clone the repository to get started:


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

imgc webp "examples/**/*.jpg"
imgc webp "examples/**/*"
```

### Specifying an output directory

```bash
imgc webp "examples/**/*" -o output_images
```

### Cleaning up generated files
**Warning**: Use this command with caution.

```bash
imgc clean "examples/**/*.webp"
```

### Command Help

For detailed command usage, `--help` or `-h` will guide you through:

```bash

```

For the `webp` command:

```bash
❯ imgc webp -h
Convert images to webp format

## Example Directory Structure
Given the following directory structure:

```bash
examples
├── 1.png
├── 1.webp
├── img1
│   ├── 2.png
│   ├── 2.webp
│   └── img11
│       ├── 3.jpg
│       └── 3.webp
├── img2
│   ├── 4.jpeg
│   └── 4.webp
```

Using imgc, you can convert all supported images to WebP, saving them either in a specified directory or alongside the original files.
